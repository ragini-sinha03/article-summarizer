# üìù Final Project: Article Summarizer

This project summarizes an online article using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including tokenization, lemmatization, sentence scoring, and sentiment analysis.

---

## ‚úÖ Project Overview

The main goals of this project were to:
- Scrape and clean an article from the web.
- Score sentences based on token and lemma frequency.
- Generate a summary based on sentence scores.
- Compare sentiment polarity between the original and the summary.
